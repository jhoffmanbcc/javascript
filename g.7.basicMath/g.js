towards math.  You can build calculators and develop and process complex
math equations.  You don't have to be a math genius to get pretty far,
and for our purposes we will be sticking to basic arithmetic */

/* Sometimes when you divide you receive a remainder.  
In coding we call this a "float" because there is a decimal 
4.876  is a number with a remainder or a float. 

When using the % modulus .. it will only provide you the numbers after
the decimal place.  For example:

8 / 7 = 1.14285...
or 
8 % 7 = .14285... 

Why do we need to do this?  Great question.. 
but lets not care about that now ;)
