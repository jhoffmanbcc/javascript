we can assign to a Variable.  When we think about our language and 
communication we have simple communcication styles. words and numbers.

And complex communication types where we compound multiple elements together
to equate deeper meaning. Such as providing a list of things which could include
both words and numbers together. 

For simple data types we have:  */



// Numbers

let students = 100;

// Strings

let instructorName = "Justin";


// and complex data types that might list or an OBJECT
// a list of items is known as an array 

let x = {firstName:"Boba", lastName:"Ganoosh"};



/* So to review.. we have Numbers, Strings and Objects
There are some more.. but we will cover those later  */
