<!-- Then we are going to start learning javascript by learning how to console log with 
javascript.  Note.. currently we are placing our javascript in the body of the page, 
although in the future we will likely use an alternate document for this. 
If you place it in the body of the page we usually place it all the way at the bottom of 
the page so that the visual appearance of the page of html and css loads first, and the 
interactive components of javascript load later. -->

/* The wonderful thing about html is that it is very visual.  
Essentially everything we created was instantly displayed to view. 
Javascript kinda runs in the background.. 

Some of the ways in which to get visual results with javascript are
using console log, which displays in the console.  Not our web page.

Another is an alert.. which will create a popup on our page.

Let's check those out 

*/


console.log('oh.. hello there friend');

/* now we need to open our webpage and check the console in the inspector to see the secret message */

alert('now we are popping off!!');

/* Here is an alert!! */

/* Cool .. now next.. we will create our own javascript file */
