// 1. Basic String 

let fuzzy = 'wuzzy';
console.log(fuzzy);

// 2. You can do basic design tricks like moving down a line with \n 

let bear = 'Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear';
console.log(bear);
let hair = "Fuzzy Wuzzy\nhad no hair";
console.log(hair);

//note if you are going to use an appostrophe in your string be 
// sure to use double quotes.
