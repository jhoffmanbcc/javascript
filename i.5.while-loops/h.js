 /* Looking at loops. 

 First off .. what is a loop?  
 A loop is a function that repeats itself in a loop or circle
 It will end the loop/circle when the equation is false. 

 For example:

 I will run around the track until I reach 100 laps.  
 Then I will quit.  
 Thats right.. I won't stop.. I quit!!


This is useful to repeat activities and automate processes.

Ready to become an automation expert???


Ok.  A while loop has 3 parts:

1. Initiatlize / declare a variable
2. Set an test or equation .. like < 100
3. Run the loop.

var laps = 0;

while (laps < 100) {

    laps+=1;
    console.log(laps);
}
