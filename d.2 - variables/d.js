It discusses:  Let, Const, and Var

Var is the most flexible variable.... 
you can declare and redeclare as you wish.

*/

/* You can also assign a variable to another variable.  
For example below we will assign the number 5 to a variable. 
Then we will assign that variable to another variable */

/* initialize the variable */
var numNumber;

/* Assign the variable */
numNumber = 5;

/* initialize a new variable */

var newVariable;

/* assign one variable to another variable */

newVariable = numNumber;

/* now newVariable will equal 5 */

console.log(newVariable);

/* We can store many things within a variable:  
Numbers, a String, an Object, a Fuction, etc */


/* Now I will add my name and the date with variables */

var myName = 'Justin Hoffman';
console.log(myName);

var theMonth = 'March';
var theYear = 2020;

console.log(theMonth + theYear);
